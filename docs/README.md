<h1>Documentation</h1>
1. Install the [Doxygen CLI](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html) and add it to your PATH system variable.
2. Then run this in the ./docs directory: <code>$ doxygen </code> and the documentation will be created in another docs folder.
3. Remember to delete documentation when pushing!!!
