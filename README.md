## HowTo
Building this fork of ChessPlusPlus is not as complicated as building the others. There are three main steps to build.
<br>
1. Follow the tutorial for your IDE [here](http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/) to get SFML started.
<br>
2. Add the source code files in [./dist](https://github.com/usandfriends/ChessPlusPlus/tree/master/dist) to your project source files and add the files in [./dist/res](https://github.com/usandfriends/ChessPlusPlus/tree/master/dist/res) to your project resources. Learn about how to add files to your IDE [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+add+resources+to+xcode&oq=how+to+add+resources+to+xcode&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.8996j1j7&sourceid=chrome&espv=210&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8#es_sm=119&espv=210&q=how+to+add+resources+to+%24IDE_NAME&safe=active) and replace $IDE_NAME with the name of your IDE.
<br>
3. Build with <i>-lstdc++</i> and <i>-std=c++11</i>.
